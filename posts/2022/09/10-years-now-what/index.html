This might be the bad pizza I had earlier talking (BOOM Jerry Maguire reference!),but This year marks ten years since I graduated and I find myself thinking about this question, Should i retire, move to Peru, change my name to Javier, grow a ponytail, start Alpaca farm and never touch a computer never again?  Probably Not. I could pull off a ponytail though.">

<p>This might be the bad pizza I had earlier talking (BOOM Jerry Maguire reference!),but This year marks ten years since I graduated and I find myself thinking about this question, Should i retire, move to Peru, change my name to Javier, grow a ponytail, start Alpaca farm and never touch a computer never again?  Probably Not. I could pull off a ponytail though.</p>
<p>The answer is no because i love being an engineer. That&rsquo;s who I am. I love creating new things or breaking old ones to make them better. For me a job was a way to do just that(and pay the rent of course!).  That said, at this point, I need more than that from a job. I need to know I am making some kind of impact. If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?. Basically, I need to know I was successful but how can anyone define success. Is it money, authority, experience, Know-how, legacy? who knows?</p>
<p>The fact is I was lucky to work in an interesting industry with super smart people (way smarter than me), I got to travel a bit for work, Represent my team in front of customers, executives and dozens of industry experts. I worked with super smart nice hardworking people, whom I am still friend with. I got the chance to interview, hire and train many great engineers(even though i was never a manager) who ended up in companies all over the world and that&rsquo;s something I am proud of.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t not all roses. It can&rsquo;t be. I did quit academia after one year because I couldn&rsquo;t accept the toxic environment(maybe more in separate post). After that I moved to industry, and it&rsquo;s not ia secret that we are in stressful and competitive industry. There is always a new project, a new technology, new language, new standard, new everything. And of course endless stream of deadlines. Did it have a toll on me? yes, Do i regret it? sometimes.  Honestly, A long sabbatical doesn&rsquo;t sound like a bad idea right now. or does it?</p>
<p>Anyway, To answer the real question here &ldquo;Now, What?&rdquo;. No idea. Meanwhile, I will keep doing what i always did. &ldquo;Just keep swimming.&rdquo;..That&rsquo;s another finding nemo reference BTW :)</p>
