During DVcon this year, I attended a lot of presentations and had great discussions with awesome people. It is really weird how we sometimes have the same idea at the same time. Like exactly the same idea!

        <p>Have you ever read a paper or while talking to someone, and you think this is a good idea. It&rsquo;s really good that you had it before.</p>
<p>During DVcon this year, I attended a lot of presentations and had great discussions with awesome people. It is really weird how we sometimes have the same idea at the same time. Like exactly the same idea!</p>
<p>Apparently, This has a name &ldquo;Multiple discovery&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The concept of multiple discovery (also known as simultaneous invention) is the hypothesis that most scientific discoveries and inventions are made independently and more or less simultaneously by multiple scientists and inventors</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It kinda makes sense. As in our industry, we have the same education, face the same problems, work with the same tools and have the same goals. Basically, there are a lot of smart people trying to do the same thing.</p>
<p>The problem is that most of the time, we can&rsquo;t share all ideas or solutions we come up with(maybe only inside our organizations). That&rsquo;s why dvcon and other conferences are so important. At least, it&rsquo;s a chance to air out these ideas and hope and they make sense to someone else.</p>
<p>I wish there is some kind of AI-Based system where I can write an idea anonymously and the system tells me if someone else has the same idea and we all can work on the idea. Any chance anyone has the same idea?!</p>
