I was told something that I didn&rsquo;t know how to respond to. I didn&rsquo;t say anything at the time, but it bugged me for few hours then I thought of something and didn&rsquo;t think about since(Good will hunting?!).
Anyway, someone said

Your purpose is lost in search of limelight.

It took me few seconds to parse and process the statement. English is my second language and the wording didn&rsquo;t seem right to me. What in the name of google-translate does this mean?">

<p>Eventually, I understood what he really meant and this is my thought process that day with memes of the great Ron Burgundy. FYI anchorman is the greatest comedy ever made</p>
<ul>
<li>Denial: limelight?  Me? I am absolutely not looking for limelight. What ? Where? When?  I never had a purpose. Are you sure you have the right Ahmed? It&rsquo;s a very common arabic name.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/saywhat.png" alt="Example image"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Anger: Yo, Dude, did you just call me attention w-seeker? Maybe we should step outside and sort this out.
<img src="/anger.png" alt="Example image"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bargaining: ok, hear me out. Can we really say that? I may be looking for the limelight. Just a little bit. Who isn&rsquo;t really?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/actuall-important.jpg" alt="Example image"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Depression: WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE? IS THIS ROCK BOTTOM? <em>chug a pint of Beamish</em>
<img src="/crying.jpg" alt="Example image"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acceptance: I know this is meant as insult, but I will take as compliment. It&rsquo;s sounds too poetic to be angry about it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/that-amazing.jpg" alt="Example image"></p>
<p>Joking aside, There is a fine line between being showy and just communicate/network with people. I find it very funny that someone thinks I am showy because anyone who knows me or worked with me would know that I hate to be in the spotlight(or limelight or whatever he called it). That said, I love to collaborate with people, work on initiatives/projects. Even better, learn something new together. This is the only way to learn and grow. The only way to work with interesting wicked smart (another good will hunting!) people.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming to my Ted talk!</p>
