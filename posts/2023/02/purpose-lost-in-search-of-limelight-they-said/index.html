<p>I was recently told something that I didn&rsquo;t know how to respond to. I didn&rsquo;t say anything at the time, but it bugged me for few hours then I thought of something and didn&rsquo;t think about since(Good will hunting?!).</p>
<p>Anyway, someone said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your purpose is lost in search of limelight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It took me few seconds to parse and process the statement. English is my second language and the wording didn&rsquo;t seem right to me. What in the name of google-translate does this mean?</p>
<p>Eventually, I understood what he really meant and this is my thought process that day with Memes of the great Ron burgundy</p>
<ul>
<li>Denial: limelight?  Me? I am absolutely not looking for limelight. What ? Where? When?  I don&rsquo;t even have a purpose. Are you sure you have the right Ahmed? It&rsquo;s a very common arabic name.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/saywhat.png" alt="Example image"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Anger: Yo, Dude, did you just call me attention w-seeker? Maybe we should step outside and sort this out.
<img src="/anger.png" alt="Example image"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bargaining: ok, hear me out. Can we really say that? I may be looking for the limelight. Just a little bit. Who isn&rsquo;t really?
<img src="/actuall-important.jpg" alt="Example image"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depression: WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE? IS THIS ROCK BOTTOM? <em>chug a pint of Beamish</em>
<img src="/crying.jpg" alt="Example image"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acceptance: I know this is meant as insult, but I will take as compliment. It&rsquo;s sounds too poetic to be angry about it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/that-amazing.jpg" alt="Example image"></p>
<p>Joking aside, There is a fine line between being showy and just communicate/network with people. I find if very funny that someone thinks I am showy because anyone how knows me or worked with me, would know that I hate to be in spotlight(or limelight or whatever he called it). That said, I love to collaborate with people, work on initiatives/projects. Even better, learn something new together. This is the only way to learn and grow. The way to work with interesting wicked smart (another good will hunting reference!) people.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming to my Ted talk!</p>
