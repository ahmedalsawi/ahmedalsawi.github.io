      <description>Disclaimer: I am writing this post while recovering from 3-day covid-y fever. So, there is a chance that memes to technical details ratio is alarmingly high. If you want the boring technical stuff, read the paper :^)
This post is about dvcon paper titled SAWD: Systemverilog Assertions waveform based development tool which was a weekend project that escalated quickly.
Problem statement Starting with problem statement, I will just use this xkcd joke that I am big fan of :)</description>

      <description>Have you ever read a paper or while talking to someone, and you think this is a good idea. It&amp;rsquo;s really good that you had it before.
During DVcon this year, I attended a lot of presentations and had great discussions with awesome people. It is really weird how we sometimes have the same idea at the same time. Like exactly the same idea!
Apparently, This has a name &amp;ldquo;Multiple discovery&amp;rdquo;:</description>
