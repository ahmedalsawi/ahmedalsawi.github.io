      <description>People talk about the smell of a new car, but nobody talks about the smell of new computer. The smell of plastic and potential :)
I recently retired my veteran Ideapad after battery, battery socket and eventually screen failed. safe to say, I got my money worth out of it. Honestly, I am surprised it lasted 7 years!
Reset in peace(RIP), my friend!
I decided to get another Ideapad. After research for few days, I found what I am looking for.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: This is a joke/rant post. If sarcasm is not your thing, Please, skip this one.
I was told something that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to respond to. I didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything at the time, but it bugged me for few hours then I thought of something and didn&amp;rsquo;t think about since(Good will hunting?!).
Anyway, someone said
 Your purpose is lost in search of limelight.
 It took me few seconds to parse and process the statement.</description>

      <title>Irish tax calculation using Python Jupyter notebook</title>

      <description>For few years now I have using google sheets to keep track of taxes and check payroll tax calculations (trust but verify, Right?). Anyway, I decided to move to Jupyter notebook/python combo to do the calculations. This is small code to calculate the Irish tax (PAYE, USC, PRSI). I have a bigger dashboard with ESPP, RSU and bonus but I thought it would be an overkill here.

      <description>Have you ever read a paper or while talking to someone, and you think this is a good idea. It&amp;rsquo;s really good that you had it before.
During DVcon this year, I attended a lot of presentations and had great discussions with awesome people. It is really weird how we sometimes have the same idea at the same time. Like exactly the same idea!
Apparently, This has a name &amp;ldquo;Multiple discovery&amp;rdquo;:</description>

      <description>We all know about Schrodinger&amp;rsquo;s cat, Well, At least whatever I remember from that undergrad physics. It&amp;rsquo;s a thought experiment that goes as follows:
 He imagined a box containing a radioactive atom, a vial of poison and a cat. Governed by quantum rules, the radioactive atom can either decay or not at any given moment. Thereâ€™s no telling when the moment will come, but when it does decay, it breaks the vial, releases the poison and kills the cat.</description>

      <description>Probably, you are wondering what that title means and what Bojack Horseman is doing here. Actually, This started as a serious question.
How to finish something when the reason to do that is elusive?
The thing is I have this bad habit of starting things purely for intellectual curiosity,So, I ended up with hundreds of README, dozens of git repos, half-written paper abstracts and earmarked books lurking around for years. There is too much to read and learn with very little time to do it.</description>

      <description>2 AM Saturday 17 Sep 2022 Cork City
This might be the bad pizza I had earlier talking (BOOM Jerry Maguire reference!),but This year marks ten years since I graduated and I find myself thinking about this question, Should i retire, move to Peru, change my name to Javier, grow a ponytail, start Alpaca farm and never touch a computer never again? Probably Not. I could pull off a ponytail though.</description>

      <title>Recruiting - My 2cents </title>

      <description>I have been seeing a lot hate towards recruiters these days and i can&amp;rsquo;t really understand why. really Why?
The more I think about it, recruiting is a hard job. I know it may sound simplistic(and I may be totally wrong here), It is a sales job but it is about selling the idea of candidate to a company and selling the idea of company to a candidate. It is about finding the perfect person for the perfect job at the perfect time.</description>

      <title>Commentary on Jerry Maguire mission statement</title>

      <description>Jerry Maguire is one of my all-time favourite movies. I find the mission statement Jerry wrote in his Miami hotel room the most interesting part. The idea of having a moment of clarity (breakhthrough not a breakdown) is life-changing. He (i know Jerry is not real :) ) wrote a genius document that applies to any profession really not just sports agents.
Cameron Crowe released the full mission statement on the 20th anniversary at link.</description>

      <description>A friend asked me why I am more active with blog posts recently and It&amp;rsquo;s only fitting to reply with blog post( found it funny too).
The thing is, since my undergrad years, I am used to take notes on everything. Lecture notes, project notes, problem sets notes. Probably all engineering students do.
I was introduced to the concept of a README(it has a wiki and everyhthing) back in 2011 and I was hooked.</description>
