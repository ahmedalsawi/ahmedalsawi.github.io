      <description>Background  Link to heading   My ISP has a &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; web app using Angular and REST backend. that said, their website sucks because their login form breaks my password manager. So, I have to login manually every time.
Obviously, they don&amp;rsquo;t have a documented API. so, i have to trace the xhr requests in the browser. This is a 3 hour journey to reverse engineer their login API including deepdive into their weird password encryption!</description>
