      <description>This is the first post in a series about TP-link TL-WN722N wifi adapter. it&amp;rsquo;s a cool little gadget that provides wifi over USB. This post is about usb registration from the linux driver.
Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the deep end which is the USB driver.The usb interface would eventually register network device and cfg80211 devices for ioctl
starting with entry point in the driver
module_init(rtw_drv_entry); module_exit(rtw_drv_halt); rtw_drv_entry calls usb_register to register this driver (short and sweet).</description>

      <description>I first heard about libusb back in 2011 when I was working on USRP1. At the time, USRP had a really good C++ abstraction library called UHD, which did the heavy lifting talking to libusb. Hopefully, it takes me less than a decade to do a second example.
What is libusb? libusb website says it all
 libusb is a C library that provides generic access to USB devices. It is intended to be used by developers to facilitate the production of applications that communicate with USB hardware.</description>
