      <description>This is post is about Langton&amp;rsquo;s ant. Like Conway&amp;rsquo;s game of life, It&amp;rsquo;s considered Cellular automaton.
 A cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states, such as on and off (in contrast to a coupled map lattice). The grid can be in any finite number of dimensions. For each cell, a set of cells called its neighborhood is defined relative to the specified cell.</description>

      <description>Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life is a zero-player game introduced by the mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. Well, It has it&amp;rsquo;s own wiki and all.
The rules are simple. You start with a grid of cells with initial state of either living or dead. Cells interact with neighbors to define the next generation of cells.
 Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under-population. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</description>
